The app was my course project for the course "User Interfaces" at the University of Turku.

The app is a booking system for trains. If a user has an account already, he can sign in as a user or as an admin (pass 1111). The user has also an option to sign up if he doesn't have an account.

Admin has an opportunity to edit trains and other info. A user can choose the departure date and time, destination, services and the payment method.

Using a MySQL database of tickets located on a webpage allows monitor what tickets are available since their status changes after the order had been made.
